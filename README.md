# GeneticBrainHubs
This repository provides Matlab code for reproducing figures from the paper entitled "Genetic influences on hub connectivity ofthe human connectome". The code was written using MATLAB_R2019b. Some functions are dependent on the version and should be accommodated by versions >R2017a.

### Data files
Data files required for this project are hosted on [this figshare repository](https://doi.org/XXX).
Please download and unzip the data in the root directory.

### Reproducing figures
First, add all sub-folders to the path using `setupPaths()` function from the root directory. This will also create a `makeFigures` folder.
Code to reproduce the figures is located in the `generateFigures` folder. Run the scripts from the root directory. Figures will be saved in `makeFigures` folder in the root directory.
